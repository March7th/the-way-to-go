Go provides a collection of packages, grouped under net, that make it easy to send and receive information through the Internet,
-- make low-level network connections, and set up servers, for which Goâ€™s concurrency features (introduced in Chapter 8) are particularly useful.

This program introduces functions from two packages, net/http and io/ioutil. The http.Get function makes an HTTP request and, if there is no error,
-- returns the result in the response struct resp. The Body field of resp contains the server response as a readable stream. Next, ioutil.ReadAll
-- reads the entire response; the result is stored in b. The Body stream is closed to avoid leaking resources, and Printf
-- writes the response to the standard output.

In either error case, os.Exit(1) causes the process to exit with a status code of 1.
